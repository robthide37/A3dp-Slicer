<p><strong>this test is still in development, beta should work "ok" for now though.<br> your current print settings will need to be saved before clicking "generate" since it uses the saved values to create the model</strong></p>
<p>note: this test will auto pull all your currently loaded config parameters and generate a model for you to print!<br> for to help with firmware speed/processing limitations it's reccomended to have most extrusion roles similar set to speeds.</p>

<h2>How to tune your printer for Pressure/Linear Advance</h2>
<p>todo add detaisl here</p>
<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>Before doing this test, it's preferable to tune everything else first!<br>i would reccomended setting XXXX to the same speeds, XXX to a slow speed, and everything else you can send it with.</p>
<p>note: having large variance with ER speeds can reduce print quality/dimensional accuracy this is effect is mainly caused by the inner perimeter getting pulled closer to the external perimeter as it cools down, since each perimeter would be at different temperatues.</p>
<p><strong>TODO add things about PA and setting first layer correctly<br>add notes about fan speed and disabling fan speed for this test, or do i have check box in GUI that would auto change relavent UI tab?</strong></p>
